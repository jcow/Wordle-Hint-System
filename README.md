# Wordle Hint System

I quickly learned I'm terrible at Wordle so I instead invested a hour or so to build a hint system.


## Usage
`python main.py`

On prompt, enter in the results of your guess
Example:

```
Enter in the results from the previous guess:

c-y a-y j-n o-y n-y
```

is the result from guessing `cajon`

I didn't spent much time playing the game and haven't looked at online solutions from others. A lot could be simply Googling other folks solutions and playing the game more.

This however has been guessing the system in around 4-5 tries.

A simple fitness script could also be written to find how often the system guesses the right answer to determine the fitness of the guesser as changes are made.
